This package emulates [[https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround][surround.vim]] by [[https://github.com/tpope][Tim Pope]]. The functionality is wrapped into a minor mode.

This package uses [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil][Evil]] as its vi layer.

* Installation

To enable it through [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]], add the following lines to =~/.emacs= or =~/.emacs.d/init.el=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package evil-surround
    :ensure t
    :config
    (global-evil-surround-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

Alternatively, can add the =evil-surround.el= file to your load-path and add =(require 'evil-surround)= to your init file.

Also, Instead of enabling it globally, you can also enable =surround-mode= along a major mode by adding =turn-on-surround-mode= to the mode hook.

* Usage
** Add surrounding

You can surround in visual-state with =S<textobject>= or =gS<textobject>=.
Or in normal-state with =ys<textobject>= or =yS<textobject>=.

** Change surrounding

You can change a surrounding with =cs<old-textobject><new-textobject>=.

** Delete surrounding

You can delete a surrounding with =ds<textobject>=.

** Add new surround pairs

A surround pair is this (trigger char with textual left and right
strings):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(?> . ("<" . ">"))
#+END_SRC

or this (trigger char and calling a function):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(?< . surround-read-tag)
#+END_SRC

You can add new by adding them to =evil-surround-pairs-alist=.
For more information do: =C-h v evil-surround-pairs-alist=.

=evil-surround-pairs-alist= is a buffer local variable, which means that
you can have different surround pairs in different modes. By default =<=
is used to insert a tag, in C++ this may not be useful - but inserting
angle brackets is, so you can add this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'c++-mode-hook (lambda ()
                             (push '(?< . ("< " . " >")) evil-surround-pairs-alist)))
#+END_SRC

Don't worry about having two entries for =<= surround will take the
first.

Or in Emacs Lisp modes using ` to enter ` ' is quite useful, but not
adding a pair of ` (the default behavior if no entry in
=evil-surround-pairs-alist= is present), so you can do this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook (lambda ()
                                    (push '(?` . ("`" . "'")) evil-surround-pairs-alist)))
#+END_SRC

without affecting your Markdown surround pairs, where the default is useful.

To change the default =evil-surround-pairs-alist= you have to use =setq-default=,
for example to remove all default pairs:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default evil-surround-pairs-alist '())
#+END_SRC

or to add a pair that surrounds with two ` if you enter ~:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default evil-surround-pairs-alist
                (push '(?~ . ("``" . "``")) evil-surround-pairs-alist))
#+END_SRC

** Add new supported operators

You can add support for new operators by adding them to =evil-surround-operator-alist=.
For more information do: =C-h v evil-surround-operator-alist=.

By default, surround works with =evil-change= and =evil-delete=.
To add support for the evil-paredit package,
you need to add =evil-paredit-change= and =evil-paredit-delete=
to =evil-surround-operator-alist=, like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'evil-surround-operator-alist
               '(evil-paredit-change . change))
  (add-to-list 'evil-surround-operator-alist
               '(evil-paredit-delete . delete))
#+END_SRC

* Examples

Here are some usage examples (taken from [[https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround][surround.vim]]):

Press =cs"'= inside

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    "Hello world!"
#+END_EXAMPLE

to change it to

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    'Hello world!'
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now press =cs'<q>= to change it to

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    <q>Hello world!</q>
#+END_EXAMPLE

To go full circle, press =cst"= to get

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    "Hello world!"
#+END_EXAMPLE

To remove the delimiters entirely, press =ds"=.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    Hello world!
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now with the cursor on "Hello", press =ysiw]= (=iw= is a text object).

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    [Hello] world!
#+END_EXAMPLE

Let's make that braces and add some space (use =}= instead of ={= for no
space): =cs]{=

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    { Hello } world!
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now wrap the entire line in parentheses with =yssb= or =yss)=.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    ({ Hello } world!)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Revert to the original text: =ds{ds)=

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    Hello world!
#+END_EXAMPLE

Emphasize hello: =ysiw<em>=

#+BEGIN_SRC html
  <em>Hello</em> world!
#+END_SRC

Finally, let's try out visual mode. Press a capital V (for linewise
visual mode) followed by =S<p class="important">=.

#+BEGIN_SRC html
  <p class="important">
    <em>Hello</em> world!
  </p>
#+END_SRC

Suppose you want to call a function on your visual selection or a text
object. You can simply press =f= instead of the aforementioned keys and
are then prompted for a functionname in the minibuffer, like with the
tags. So with:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    "Hello world!"
#+END_EXAMPLE

... after selecting the string, then pressing =Sf=, entering =print= and
pressing return you would get

#+BEGIN_SRC c
    print("Hello world!")
#+END_SRC

* FAAQ (frequently actually asked questions)
** Why does =vs= no longer surround?

This is due to an upstream change in =vim-surround=. It happened in this [[https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround/commit/6f0984a][commit]]. See the
discussion in [[https://github.com/timcharper/evil-surround/pull/48][this]] pull request for more details.
